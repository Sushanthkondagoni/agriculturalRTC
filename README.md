#Abstract
Agriculture is a backbone of our country and the major role in farming is cultivating and harvesting the crop.Efficient crop harvesting is a critical challange 
in agricultre due to the shortage of labor.Manual harvesting requires a large workforce and takes more time.The need for a more efficient and cost-effective method 
of collecting crops is necessary to address the labor shortage in farming.As technology developed different machines were introduced.Farmers are currently using 
separate machines for reaping and removing the crops from the ground.To address this issue, we have come up with a new idea An Robotic System,
to cut the leaves and pick the onions from the ground and stores in bin which is connected to cloud for data analytics.
